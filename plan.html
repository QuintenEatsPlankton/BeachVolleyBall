<title>Name: Quinten Hay</title>

<p>Goals
  
  The purpose of this website is to allow the Slammers Beach Volleyball to get on the internet, this will encourage a younger more tech savvy audience, as well as a wider audience and encourage more people to join the sport and begin to play, by allowing them to access information about the sport whenever they please.</p>
<p> Success Evaluation
  
  To evaluate if the website is successful an increase in participants for each week would be expected, furthermore the more people that sign up using the website can be another way to prove the websites success. The websites successfulness can also be measured by the website getting more hits but this way is not reliable because most people that come onto the website do not make any purchases, they are only there to browse, and also some of the visitors can be robots.  </p>
<p>Target Audience
  
  The target audience of the website is a younger audience; this is ages between 15-30, although the current people attending are between ages 35-50. To cater for a younger audience, the use of clearly formatted pages and titles for each page and each paragraph.  </p>
