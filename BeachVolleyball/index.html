<h3>Who can play</h3>
<p>There are  800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball  is a<br> sport that is safe, fun and does not require 
  extreme fitness. Since you  don&rsquo;t have to move around <br>the court too much, it&rsquo;s great for people who want a  low-impact sport that will help them get fit<br> without pushing them to their  limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic<br> because  games can be really
  exciting and intense, but there&rsquo;s always a net between you  and your<br>
  opponents. Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men  and women alike.
Anyone<br> considering starting a new sport or exercise program  should see their doctor first. </p>
