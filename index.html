<h2>Who can play</h2>

<center><p>There are  800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball  is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. Since you  don&rsquo;t have to move around the court too much, it&rsquo;s great for people who want a  low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their  limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because  games can be really exciting and intense, but there&rsquo;s always a net between you  and your opponents. Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike. Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program  should see their doctor first. </p></center>
